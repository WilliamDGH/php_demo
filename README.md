# Digistorm Junior Dev Test

Hosted [Here](http://digistorm-gallery.epizy.com/?i=1)

A PHP app that reads the image files from a set directory and display them on browser.

It can detect file type and only select image files, it will go down the file path to scan for all sub directories as well.


## Approach

PHP is new to me, I know absolutely nothing about PHP before I began this test. I sort of learn on the task, by watching youtube tutorials and official [PHP manual](https://www.php.net/docs.php).

Firstly, I learnt how to read files and directories using `readdir` method, and using `glob` method to filter out none image files. Then I was facing with the challenge of go down to more than one level of directories.

Luckily, I found out about `RecursiveDirectoryIterator::__construct` method. And found an approach on Stack Overflow about using `RecursiveDirectoryIterator` and `RecursiveIteratorIterator` together to go down the directory tree as deep as possible.

## Challenges

Honestly, the whole project was a challenge. It's not about the test, but rather I had to solve it using a brand new language. I leant a lot through my failures, and hopefully my result is good enough to pass the test.
